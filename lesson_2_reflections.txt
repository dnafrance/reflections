- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git directory is created to store git version control metadata.
It allows version control.
-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allows an intermediate stage between final commit and working
directory.
- How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
Ensure using git diff and git status periodically to verify the status of the
working directory and the staging area w.r.t. committed changes. This will
ensure you can commit per logical change.
- What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?
Branches would help in testing out experimental features or changes unconnected
with main branch.
