How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

+ and - prefixes showed which lines were added and removed

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Allow you to rollback changes in case of mistakes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Pros: You know the point where committed, with the changes saved till that point.
In Google docs, you won't know at what point it is saved.
Cons: You have to do it manually

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is oriented towards coding, but Google Docs is more general-purpose.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

1.  cd into the repository
2.  git log
3. git diff first_id second_id

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Improve confidence because of the ability to track errors in previous versions
using git diff and git checkout

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Use it for version control while coding. Also use it with color-coded prompts.

Git commands - setting up workspace with editor:
git config --global core.editor "subl -n -w"
git config --global push.default upstream
git config --global merg.conflictstyle diff3
